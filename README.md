# Hate-Speech-Detection-using-LSTM-CNN-Architecture

We developed a Deep Learning Model for detecting and categorizing hate speech on social media using LSTM-CNN architecture. For doing this we utilized a dataset of approximately 1.6 million rows of manually labeled comments to train and evaluate our model. This model achieved an accuracy of 91% and an F1 score of 0.8 with the LSTM-CNN model, outperforming other ML models.
